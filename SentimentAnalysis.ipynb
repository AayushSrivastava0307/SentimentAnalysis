    "### What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "Sentiment analysis classifies whether a text block is positive, negative, or neutral. The goal that Sentiment mining tries to gain is to analyze people's opinions in a way that can help businesses expand. It focuses on polarity (positive, negative & neutral) and emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.). It uses various Natural Language Processing algorithms such as Rule-based, Automatic, and Hybrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario if we want to analyze whether a product satisfies customer requirements or if there is a need for this product in the market. We can use sentiment analysis to monitor that product's reviews. Sentiment analysis is also efficient when there is a large set of unstructured data, and we want to classify that data by automatically tagging it. Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys are used extensively to learn how a customer perceives a product or service. Sentiment analysis also gained popularity due to its ability to process significant NPS responses and obtain consistent results quickly."

    "**Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis** <br>\n",
    "This depends on the polarity base. This category can be upbeat, positive, neutral, negative, or harmful. The rating is done on a scale of 1 to 5. If the rating is 5, it is very positive, 2 is negative, and three is neutral.<br>\n",
    "**Emotion detection**<br>\n",
    "The sentiments happy, sad, angry, upset, jolly, pleasant, and so on come under emotion detection. It is also known as a lexicon method of sentiment analysis.<br>\n",
    "**Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**<br>\n",
    "It focuses on a particular aspect. For instance, if a person wants to check the features of the cell phone, then it checks the aspects such as the battery, screen, and camera quality, then aspect-based is used.<br>\n",
    "**Multilingual Sentiment Analysis**<br>\n",
    "Multilingualism consists of different languages; the classification must be positive, negative, and neutral. This is highly challenging and comparatively difficult.<br><br>\n",
